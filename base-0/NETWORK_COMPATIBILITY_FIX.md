# Network Compatibility Fix

## Issue Resolved
The application was throwing errors when users connected with Ethereum mainnet (chain ID 1) instead of Filecoin networks, because the Synapse SDK only supports:
- Filecoin Mainnet (chain ID 314)
- Filecoin Calibration Testnet (chain ID 314159)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Graceful Error Handling
- Modified `useSynapseStorage` hook to catch initialization errors without failing
- Updated both playground and history pages to handle storage initialization gracefully
- Added proper error logging for debugging while preventing user-facing crashes

### 2. Fallback Storage System
- The app now continues to work with localStorage when Synapse SDK fails to initialize
- All prompt and image saving functionality works regardless of network
- Users can still use the full application even on non-Filecoin networks

### 3. User Feedback
- Added visual notifications to inform users about storage status
- Yellow notification explains the network limitation and that data is still being saved
- Green notification confirms when Synapse storage is successfully connected
- Educational message guides users about switching to Filecoin for full features

### 4. Network Compatibility
- ✅ **Ethereum Mainnet**: Works with localStorage fallback
- ✅ **Polygon, BSC, etc.**: Works with localStorage fallback  
- ✅ **Filecoin Mainnet**: Full Synapse storage features
- ✅ **Filecoin Calibration**: Full Synapse storage features

## User Experience
- No more crashes or error screens
- Clear feedback about storage status
- App functionality preserved regardless of network
- Educational guidance for users who want full Filecoin features

## Files Modified
- `/src/hooks/useSynapseStorage.ts` - Added error handling in initialization
- `/src/app/playground/page.tsx` - Added storage status tracking and notifications  
- `/src/app/history/page.tsx` - Added graceful error handling for data loading

## Technical Implementation
The solution maintains backward compatibility while adding robust error handling:

```typescript
// Graceful initialization with fallback
try {
  await storage.initialize();
  setStorageInitialized(true);
} catch (err) {
  // Log for debugging but don't fail
  console.warn('Synapse storage initialization failed:', err);
  // App continues with localStorage
}
```

This ensures users can access all app features immediately while providing clear guidance for optimal storage experience.
